- Hi, I’m Sean Gaygen
- I started programming by learning how to use an Arduino.
- I then transitioned to C++ by finishing Euler Project problems.
- I eventually switched again to Python through further Eulers, Advent of Code, and multiple personal projects.
- I have also dabbled with web-development on-and-off (HTML, CSS, Javascript & Jquery) through Django.
- For the last two years, I've been working primarily with LabView for my job, along with finally attending college.
- Reach me at Sean@Gaygen.com
