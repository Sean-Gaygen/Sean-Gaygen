- Hi, I’m Sean Gaygen
- I started programming by learning how to use an Arduino.
- As that's just C with some extra functions, I transitioned to C++ pretty easily by finishing Euler Project problems.
- I then transitioned to Python through further Eulers, Advent of Code, and multiple personal projects. I'm definitely most comfortable with Python.
- I'm currently learning web-development (HTML, CSS, Javascript & Jquery) through Django.
- Reach me at Sean@Gaygen.com
